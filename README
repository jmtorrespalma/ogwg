What is it?
-----------

The Oldie Goldie Website Generator is a simple but powerful static site
generator. This aims to generate very simple websites based on pre-established
templates and some of the Unix classic tools for parsing text. Was created to
provide an easy and DIY method to generate the website tofcg.com.

Latest version
--------------

The OGWG project is originally being hosted on Github, more concretely in the
address https://github.com/jmtorrespalma/ogwg.git, but the intention is to
migrate it to a private server while maintaining this one as a mirror.

Documentation
-------------

The only sources of documentation are this file, along with the commented
souce code and the provided templates but due to the simplicity of the tool,
it's considered to be enough.

Here is some description on the project source tree:
COPYING                  License of this program.
README                   Introduction and info about the project.

Building
--------
To build it, simply cd to project root directory and type:
  make all

Usage
-----
This project is now set for my personal preferences. If you want to use it as a
blog just add your posts in .prehtml format to the posts directory. There is an
example named 'posts/template-file.html' that you might use as a guide.
