# This is a list of wanted features for the project.

 * Improve current .css template to get better readability, maybe setting black
   color on the side margins. It's important to keep simplicity.
 * Add cv, generated probably from .tex file. Using latex2html is very suitable
   for this task, but it's important to tweak it to generate the html in a
   proper format.
 * Decide which is the best design and purpose for the main page (news
   probably)
 * Projects page is useful to talk in detail about some of the project that I
   have worked in, adding references to git server.
 * Add support for automatic spell checking with hunspell or any other spell
   checking tool.
 * Write content for the project. (Personal)
