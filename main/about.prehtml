	<h2>About this webpage</h2>
	<p>The main purpose of this webpage is mostly being useful to me, the
	author (see net section for details). I wanted to have a webpage for
	many reasons, but mostly, in a true good hearted intention to do
	something usefull in this world and share what I know, what I do
	and what I think about many different topics. As a computer engineer,
	I like sharing what I do and keep track of what I do and learn,
	cause sometimes it's important to go back and know how I solved a
	previous problem. Hopefully, apart from being useful to me in many
	different ways (I tend to forget stuff sometimes), some people learning
	about the same things, or willing to criticise me for not knowing what
	I am talking about, can make good use of it.</p>

	<p>My goal is using this blog to share what I know, keep learning, and
	be able to share my experiences and thoughts. I don't even know what I
	will be talking about, but you can expect technology, programming,
	travelling and even personal experiences. Weird combination right? I
	guess it will be hard to choose a topic for this blog, but plain and
	simple, the topic is anything I want to write about.</p>

	<p>The name of this site is not a random name, it makes sense. I was
	born at the beginning of the 90s, when technologies like internet and
	PCs were still in a very early stage, but most technologies at that
	point were simple enough to be possible for a person to understand
	them.</p>

	<p>This is my website, personal website, so I take responsability for
	everything that is said here, however, that also allows me to say
	anything I want, and In any way that I want. That's why swearing
	and cursing happens often I mostly write in English about computer
	related stuff, but simce my family is all Spanish and I don't want
	them to feel left apart, I sporadically write in Spanish too. Japanese
	is not common at all, but I am learning the language so sometimes I do
	it as it is useful in my learning process</p>

	<p>A los que habláis español, bienvenidos, en esta web hablo de todo un
	pero sobre todo en inglés por motivos de eficiencia. Un texto en inglés
	tiene una audiencia potencial mayor, por lo que puede ser útil a más
	gente. Otro motivo es porque en este mundillo de la tecnología, el
	inglés es el lenguaje estándar así que para mantener la documentación
	compacta prefiero hacerlo en inglés. En realidad, dependiendo del tema
	que quiero tratar, y de la audiencia a la que me estoy destinando
	utilizo un idioma u otro. Familia, siempre que hable de vosotros lo
	haré en español, pero me gustaría que esto os sirviera como una
	motivación para aprender inglés, que nunca es tarde ;) </p>

	<p>Maybe you have noticed the strange title of the post, have you?
	Well, for geeks and technology savvy people it's not much of a surprise
	but basically is a computer reference. Calling the first post 'post 0'
	is a reference to my native language: C, because in C, things start
	counting from zero. Ah, how easy would be life if everybody started
	to count from zero. Same as if we had 8 fingers, math would be much
	easier for every single one of us...But anyway, probably you are not
	even interested. Too much for a 'post 0', I hope the quality of the
	posts go increasing ove the time cause it looks a bit crappy right
	now.</p>

	<p>If you want to know more about 8 fingered humanity adventages or why
	starting to count from zero is good, let me know in the comments, but
	oh wait!...there are no goddamn comments in this blog. If there were, I
	would ignore them anyway.</p>
