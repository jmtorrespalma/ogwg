	<h2>Post 0: Hello World</h2>
	<small> 2016/10/02 </small>
	<p>That's it. I'm finally doing it. After a few months and years of
	having it in the to-do list, finally I have taken the time and patience
	required to create my own webpage.</p>

	<p>Currently I'm writing this from a コインランドリ (coin laundry) in
	Gotanda, Tokyo. Today is October 2nd of 2016, and this is my first post
	for my blog/webpage. It's probably the latest place that I would expect
	to write my first post from, but life always has surprises. While
	waiting for my laundry to finish, I start a new adventure online. How
	beautiful and poetic does it sound?</p>

	<p>Honestly, it must sound really weird that a 24 years old has decided
	to write his own blog on his own, taking into account that living in a
	time where Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and others are the de-facto
	standard for sharing stuff about your life. <b>So why am I taking the
	time to do all of this?</b> Probably this is all better explained in
	the 'about' page, but basically, I don't like giving my data, rights
	over my work and free information to some _evil_ companies. In
	addition, I like sharing my life with people who care about me and I
	can share in the way I want, not the predefined way those applications
	are forcing me to do it.</p>

	<p>My goal is using this blog to share what I know, keep learning, and
	be able to share my experiences and thoughts. I don't even know what I
	will be talking about, but you can expect technology, programming,
	travelling and even personal experiences. Weird combination right? I
	guess it will be hard to choose a topic for this blog, but plain and
	simple, the topic is anything I want to write about.</p>

	<p>Maybe you have noticed the strange title of the post, have you?
	Well, for geeks and technology savvy people it's not much of a surprise
	but basically is a computer reference. Calling the first post 'post 0'
	is a reference to my native language: C, because in C, things start
	counting from zero. Ah, how easy would be life if everybody started
	to count from zero. Same as if we had 8 fingers, math would be much
	easier for every single one of us...But anyway, probably you are not
	even interested. Too much for a 'post 0', I hope the quality of the
	posts go increasing ove the time cause it looks a bit crappy right
	now.</p>

	<p>If you want to know more about 8 fingered humanity adventages or why
	starting to count from zero is good, let me know in the comments, but
	oh wait!...there are no goddamn comments in this blog. If there were, I
	would ignore them anyway.</p>
