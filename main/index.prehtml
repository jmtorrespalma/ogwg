	<h2>The old fashioned computer geek</h2>
	<p>Welcome to an officialy accredited waste of resources. This
	web is probably using more bandwith and domain names than it should
	(even if it's only one), but I'm personally paying for every bit that
	I'm using, so it's my business.</p>

	<p>I'm using this page mostly as a life log to remember some of
	the hings that I learn, keep my family and friends updated about
	my life, or to express my opinion about certain topics, so be
	adviced that here you might find a lot of things that you might
	not like or even get offended by. Honestly, I don't give a f**k, this
	is the place where I can be free and say what I want.</p>

	<p>Eventually you might find something useful here too, especially
	if you like computers and technology, the site title is very
	descriptive itself, so take a look at my projects, blog or cv
	if you are interested.</p>

	<p>Just as a final statement, I plan to write in English, Spanish or
	Japanese, depending on the topic that I'm covering and mood that I
	am in.</p>

	<p>Enjoy the ride here. <i>Hasta la vista baby.</i></p>
